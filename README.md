# Welcome Week Games Jam Tank Game

Tank Game is a third person tank shooter. It was made in Unity by myself, Daniel Marker and Brandon Hacking as part of the 'Staffs University Welcome Week Game Jam In Cooperation With Codemasters And Playground'.

### Playing the game
The game itself is contained within FinalBuild.zip and only needs to be unzipped to be played.

### Using the project files
The project was written in version 2019.1.3f1 of Unity, so if you want to use the project files I would recommend using that version of Unity.
